# Weather App

A simple React-based weather application that allows you to check the current temperature for a city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Weather App on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following software installed on your computer:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): Included with Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Navigate to the project directory


2. cd weather-app
Install the project dependencies


3. npm install

### Usage
Sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key in the handleSubmit function in Content.js.

Start the development server


npm start
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the Weather App.

Enter the name of a city and click the "Submit" button to check the current temperature for that city.

### 
Customization
You can customize the appearance and styling of the application by modifying the CSS in content.css.
You can extend the functionality by adding more features, such as displaying additional weather data (e.g., humidity, wind speed), providing a five-day forecast, or allowing users to switch between different units (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit).
